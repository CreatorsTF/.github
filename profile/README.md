# Creators.TF
Creators.TF was an attempt by various content creators of the Team Fortress 2 community to get together and ship custom, themed updates to a group of dedicated servers for the community to enjoy. You can check out our archive website to learn more about the project.

The project was shut down on March 2022 due to low interest and zero motivation from the team, financial issues and more less important factors.
